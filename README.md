                   WHY USE AN ADVERTISING AND TRACKING NETWORKS BLOCK LIST WITH LIMITED NUMBER OF RULES? 
In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20% mark while the number three (Comscore) just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. Just have a look at the usage statistics on the W3tech website (check the advertising, analysis and tag managers) see https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/advertising. 

A study performed by Brave browser seems to support above claim: QUOTE "WE FOUND THAT ONLY 201 RULES ACCOUNTED FOR 90% OF THE BLOCKING ACTIVITY" (see https://brave.com/the-mounting-cost-of-stale-ad-blocking-rules/).

                                                  LOW UPDATE FREQUENCY
Like Peter Low explains on his website (https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/index.php), you need to focus on the advertising and tracking networks which place the adds on the websites you visit. Such a list is not subjective to a lot of changes for three reasons. 

1. It takes a lot of time and money to build an (ad serving) backbone network. 

2. The digital advertising market is more or less saturated. Also the AI-generated results are a threat for the digital advertising. People often find the answer in the AI-generated answer, which reduces the effectiveness of search engine advertising. The chance of a new adnetwork entering this market and gaining a substantial marketshare (of more than 1% :-) is therefore (very) low.  

3. The digital marketeers using these networks are a constraining factor too, because most people don't like to learn how to use new software. So human reluctance to change also limits the chances of a new adnetwork to popup. 

                                                          SOURCES
The blocklists are based on surveys of most used advertising and tracking technology (e.g. surveys of W3C, W3Tech and the digital marketing community itself). The online advertising industry likes to keep lists of top performing companies in the ad supply chain (including advertising exchange platforms). Ironically these studies can also be used against them. These list and surveys are oriented on Europe and North America, this is the reason this slim (elss than 500 rules) blocklist contains mostly EU and US based advertising and tracking networks. 

                                                      SUGGESTED USE

This list works fine with english adfilter of Easylist or Adguard base filter with your local language filtering list. For people using Peter Lowe's list I would either use my list or Peter Low's.

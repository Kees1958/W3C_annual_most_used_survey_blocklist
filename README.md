This blocklist is based on surveys of most used advertising and tracking technology (e.g. surveys of W3C, W3Tech and the
digital marketing community itself). The online advertising industry likes to keep lists of top performing companies in
the ad supply chain (including advertising exchange platforms). The list and surveys monitored are oriented on Europe and 
North America, this is the reason this blocklist contains mostly EU and US based advertising and tracking networks. 

                                WHY USE A SMALL ADVERTISING AND TRACKING NETWORKS BLOCK LIST? 
In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20 percent mark 
while the number three (Comscore) just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. For comparison Amazon with its huge webstore generates 
about the same advertising traffic on its own website. Number 100 on this list is probably used at 5000 websites of the Alexa 
Top 300.000 websites, while number 500 may only track you on 250 websites of the Alexa Top 10.000.000. 

This study performed by the Brave browser developers supports above claim (scroll to "EasyList Applied at the Web" section):

==> "WE (Brave) FOUND THAT ONLY 201 RULES ACCOUNTED FOR 90% OF THE BLOCKING ACTIVITY" 

                                                  LOW UPDATE FREQUENCY
Because this list focusses on the advertising and tracking networks which place the adds on the websites you visit, this list 
is not subjective to a lot of changes. Simply because it takes a lot of time and money to build such a backbone (ad serving) 
network. Also the digital marketeers using these networks are a constraining factor, because most don't like to learn how to
use new software which makes them reluctant to change to a different advertising platform when the business advantage is marginal.

                                                      ADVICED USAGE  

For people using AdGuard MV3 experimental, I have the MV3 version: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kees1958/W3C_annual_most_used_survey_blocklist/master/EU_US_MV3_most_common_ad%2Btracking_networks.txt

People using Firefox or Edge build-in tracking protection can use:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kees1958/W3C_annual_most_used_survey_blocklist/master/addendum_to_Edge_Firefox_build_in.txt

People using AdGuard or uBlockOrigin can use the combined MV2 version: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kees1958/W3C_annual_most_used_survey_blocklist/master/EU_US_MV2_most_common_ad%2Btracking_networks.txt

You can combine one of above list with AdGuard's optimized (anti) advertising filter for optimal cosmetic filtering and performance
(optimized means this combined AdGuard+Easlylist filter only contains domains which block rules are often triggered)

                   WHY USE AN DVERTISING AND TRACKING NETWORKS BLOCK LIST WITH LIMITED NUMBER OF RULES? 
In advertising the number one (Google) has a marketshare of around 40 percent, Facebook the number two hits the 20% mark while the number three (Comscore) just has a little over 2.5% marketshare. For comparison Amazon with its huge webstore enerates about the same advertising traffic on its own website. Number 100 on this list is probably used at the top 5000 websites of the Alexa Top 300.000 websites, while number 500 may only track you on 250 websites of the Alexa Top 10.000.000. This is why the small Mv3 list is probably as effective as the experimental large list (with less chance on false positives or website breakage).

A Brave study (https://brave.com/the-mounting-cost-of-stale-ad-blocking-rules/) seems to support above claim: QUOTE "WE FOUND THAT ONLY 201 RULES ACCOUNTED FOR 90% OF THE BLOCKING ACTIVITY" 

                                                  LOW UPDATE FREQUENCY
Because this list focusses on the advertising and tracking networks which place the adds on the websites you visit. This list is not subjective to a lot of changes. Simply because it takes a lot of time and money to build such a backbone (ad serving) network. Also the digital marketeers using these networks are a constraining factor, because most don't like to learn how to use new software which makes them reluctant to change!

                                                          SOURCES
The blocklists are based on surveys of most used advertising and tracking technology (e.g. surveys of W3C, W3Tech and the digital marketing community itself). The online advertising industry likes to keep lists of top performing companies in the ad supply chain (including advertising exchange platforms). The list and surveys monitored are oriented on Europe and North America, this is the reason the slim Mv3 blocklist contains mostly EU and US based advertising and tracking networks. 

                                                      SUGGESTED USE

Like the first build-in anti-tracking of Firefox and Edge build-in filters, the EU-US most used Mv3 filter is directed to delivering maximum effect with minimal websie brwakage. That is why it is using simple third-party blocking ABP syntax for the most used advertising and tracking networks and can be used by most adblockers.

I normally use the EU-US-most used filter in combination with my extension's own adblocking filter to reduce the number of rules in my safe-surfing profile (Chrome with all website permissions on block except image, sound and scripts) and as main filter (together with my other filters) in my default profile (browser in default settings for maximum compatibility) with my other filter lists (less than 3000 rules in total) used for visiting (trusted) bookmarked websites.

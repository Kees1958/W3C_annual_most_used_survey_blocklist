! Version: 2025.11.14
!
! Please report issues related to website breakage at
! https://github.com/Kees1958/W3C_annual_most_used_survey_blocklist/issues
!
! You are allowed to use this ruleset for uBol freely, but at your own risk.
!
! My WORK profile has Brave Shields disabled and all permissions on default with no extensions installed.
! This to make sure every website I use for work and sensitive transaction works as intended.
!
! I use uBol in basic mode only in my SURFING profile as a connection filter (sort of browser firewall) 
! with all uBol filter lists disabled and Brave Shield in Aggressive mode in my SURFING profile. 
!
! This Surfing profile has all site permissions disabled (only content permissions are allowed)
! for maximum security and privacy (the old fashioned two browser profile approach).
! 
! Copy paste below lines into uBol and add or remove TLD's or country codes in first rule
